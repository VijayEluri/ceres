/**
 * <p>This package contains interfaces and classes which shall enable users to describe their data formats
 * using an interpreted language by constructing an evaluatable tree of expressions. This gives much more
 * flexibility than working with a static type tree.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>This package is experimental and the interfaces and classes contained herein
 * currently not used in the <i>binio</i> API.
